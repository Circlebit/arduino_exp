#+TITLE: Arduino Experiments

A repo for my personal experiments and practices on Arduino (and git).
The rest of this readme file is used as a notepad.

* General Notes
** including Arduino.h
 - while not neccessary in .ino files in Arduino IDE, it is required in a .cpp
 - ~#include "Arduino.h"~
 - src_c++{#include "Arduino.h"}
** Emacs/Spacemacs
*** Magit Workflow
 - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/4a62la/magit_tutorial/d0y3jbt/][basic magit commands]]
*** Emacs and Arduino

* Experiments
** blink
the 'hello world' of micro processors.
